# Jamie Dalton 
## Digital marketer turned software building enthusiast

I'm Jamie Dalton, a marketer from London with 10 years of experience running campaigns for big brands and small startups. 
In 2015 I was working with a repetative task for my job and wondered if there was a better way to achieve what I wanted. Thankfully, I picked up the excellent book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart and this kicked off a passion for learning Python and the amazing possibilities it opened up before me. 

On a project level I'm interested in Machine Learning and Data processing to help improve the way we approach the problems of the 21st Century. I'm equally interested in tackling big social problems like Climate Change and improving Public Health as I am with improving the ways in which we do business because when it comes down to it my real passion is creating something really cool.

I'm currently learning about Machine Learning - doing a 100 Days of ML challenege to get my feet wet and would be interested to collaborate on projects in that arena.
